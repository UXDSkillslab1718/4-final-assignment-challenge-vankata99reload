 <h1>Bespoke Project</h1>
<h2>Hallmark x Phivanov Consulting</h2>
<p>Made the effort with my colleague Phil to set-up the company Phivanov Consulting. Our first client was Hallmark with a 3-step action plan to transform their gift card into a bucket-list experience. 3 parts concluded of: crowdfunding, interactive card and digital unwrapping</p>

    <h3>Physical Card</h3>
    <p>Makikng it a returning occurence, Hallmark wanted to sell more card. Our idea for the phsycal card was to be unnoticable as possible as well making it appear rather mysterious. As a result, we had this jungle-themed card that was really suspicous for our user. From there, the experience unfolded.</p>

    <h3>Digital Unwrapping</h3>
      <p>Making the digital unwrapping was highly customizable as it enabled the user to take the control. While free-falling he had to save his friends by giving them parachutes. At the end, after completing this mini-game, his friends thanked him and unveiled his special bucket-list gift experience.</p>
